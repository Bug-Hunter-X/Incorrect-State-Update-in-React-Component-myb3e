This React component uses the `useState` hook to manage the component's state. However, the state update function is called incorrectly in the `handleClick` function. The function attempts to update the `count` state by adding 1, but it does so incorrectly. Instead of using the `setCount` function, it's trying to directly modify the `count` state variable.
